Roadmap:
--------

Building an end-to-end AI system as a beginner is best done by focusing on a "regression" or "classification" problem. Since you enjoy "building and breaking," we will create a **House Price Predictor**. This project is the "Hello World" of ML but allows you to touch every part of the lifecycle: data, training, API development, and deployment.

---

## The Project: Real Estate Price Predictor

You will build a system that takes features of a house (like square footage and number of rooms) and predicts its market price.

### Phase 1: The "Brain" (Model Training)

1. **Environment Setup**: Install Python and the core libraries.
* `pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`


2. **Get the Data**: Use the **California Housing Dataset** (built into Scikit-learn).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use `pandas` to see the data and `seaborn` to find correlations.
* *Break it:* Try training the model without cleaning "outliers" (like houses with 50 rooms) to see how it ruins your accuracy.


4. **Train the Model**: Use **Linear Regression** or a **Random Forest**.

$$Price = \beta_0 + \beta_1(SqFt) + \beta_2(Rooms) + \epsilon$$


5. **Save the Model**: Use `pickle` or `joblib` to export your trained model as a `.pkl` file. This "freezes" the AI so you can use it later without retraining.

### Phase 2: The "Body" (API Development)

Now, you need a way for a user to talk to your model.

1. **Framework**: Use **FastAPI** or **Flask**.
2. **The Endpoint**: Create a `/predict` route. This route will:
* Accept JSON input (e.g., `{"sq_ft": 2000, "rooms": 3}`).
* Load your `.pkl` file.
* Run the data through the model.
* Return the predicted price.


3. **Test Locally**: Run your server and use a tool like Postman or even just your browser to see the prediction.

---

### Phase 3: The "Armor" (Containerization)

To ensure it works on any machine (the "it works on my machine" fix), use **Docker**.

1. **Create a Dockerfile**: Write instructions to install Python, copy your code/model, and start the API.
2. **Build & Run**:
* `docker build -t house-price-app .`
* `docker run -p 80:80 house-price-app`


3. *Break it:* Try running the container without copying the `.pkl` file. You'll see the API crash immediately—a great lesson in **dependency management**.

---

### Phase 4: The "Home" (Deployment)

1. **GitHub**: Push your code to a repository.
2. **Streamlit (Optional)**: If you want a pretty UI instead of just a raw API, use Streamlit. It lets you build a web dashboard using only Python.
3. **Free Hosting**: Deploy the app to **Streamlit Community Cloud** or **Render**.

## Step-by-Step Learning Path

| Step | Focus | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Python/Pandas** | Load a CSV and calculate the average house price. |
| **2** | **Scikit-Learn** | Split data into "Train" and "Test" sets. |
| **3** | **Modeling** | Train your first Linear Regression model. |
| **4** | **API** | Wrap that model in a FastAPI script. |
| **5** | **Cloud** | Get a URL where anyone can access your predictor. |
